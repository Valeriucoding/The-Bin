This is a Car Park Barrier system.
When a car is detected, the buzzer will sound and a message will be displayed on the LCD screen.
If the button is pressed, the barrier will open and the car can pass through.
The tally of cars that have passed through will be displayed on the 4 digit display.
The barrier can also be controlled using the slider.

This project is part of Hackclub's Summer of Making 2024.
